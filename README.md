# 🧠 My Internet Brain

Welcome to my digital home — a space where design meets code, creativity meets strategy, and ideas find form.

## ✨ About

This site is more than a portfolio. It’s a living playground for my ideas, experiments, and projects — a reflection of my journey as a **Design Engineer**, **Software Developer**, and **Creative Partner**.

I build & design **high-converting websites**, **digital experiences**, and **software products** for founders, startups, and brands who can’t afford to get it wrong.

> Think of this place as a lab, a journal, a canvas, and a calling card.
